Use of Emotional Intelligence in Managerial   Communication in the context of Bangladesh. 

**Introduction**

In an increasingly complex and competitive global market, the success of organizations in Bangladesh is no longer solely dependent on technical skills and academic qualifications. Instead, a new paradigm is emerging where emotional intelligence (EI) is recognized as a crucial driver of effective leadership and organizational performance. Daniel Goleman mentioned in his landmark 1995 book, Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ.  Emotional Intelligence is also a far more powerful predictor of success in life than IQ alone. He draws on neuroscience and psychology to show that while IQ can get someone a job or a degree, it is emotional intelligence that determines who will be a strong leader, who will build lasting relationships, and who will be resilient in the face of life's challenges.

Emotional intelligence is not a single skill but a cluster of abilities that are vital for success and well-being in all aspects of life. Its importance can be seen across various domains.

**1.	Self-Awareness:**

In order to engage someone’s Emotional Intelligence, he/she must be able to use his/her emotions to make constructive decisions about their behaviors. When they become overly stressed, they can lose control of their emotions and the ability to act thoughtfully and appropriately.
It is not normally easy to think clearly or make rational decisions when someone becomes overly stressed. Someone’s ability to both think clearly and accurately assess emotions—his/her own and other people’s—becomes compromised during overly stressed situations. 
There are some thumb rules regarding the Stress Management:

_A.	Avoiding unnecessary stresses [4]_ 

❖	It is important to avoid the unnecessary stresses in personal or professional life. Sometimes it is important to avoid people who constantly cause stress in someone's personal or professional life. 

❖	Moreover, it is also important to take control of the surrounding environment. It is suggested as an example that when traffic makes someone more tense, then he/she should take a less-traveled route by avoiding his/her conventional transportation.  

❖	It is important to excuse or stop bringing up any controversial topic like religion or politics which leads to an argument most of the time. 

❖	It is helpful to maintain a to-do list and analyze the prioritized work to balance work life and maintain the scheduled work flow. [4]


_B.	Alternating the situation [4]_ 

❖	It is important to communicate if someone’s conversation or ideology is a bother. It is suggested to respectfully deal with the situation and make a good communication about the reluctance to talk about the particular issues. 

❖	It is also important to be willing to compromise with effective communication. Need to deal with the problems head on, by doing someone’s best to anticipate and prevent them. 

❖	Need to find a balance in work life and personal life, which can provide some pleasures and prevent being overly stressed. 


_C.	Adapting to the stressor [4]_ 

❖	It is advised to reframe problems by providing space to themselves, looking at the big picture is essential by foreseeing the future achievements. Sometimes someone should set reasonable standards for him/herself and learn to be okay with Good Enough.  

❖	Furthermore, it is important to practice gratitude, this simple strategy can help someone to keep things in perspective. 

D.	Accepting the things that can’t be changed [4]

❖	It is wise to accept the situation when the sources or events are unavoidable. It is suggested not to control the uncontrollable situation rather look for the upside and learn from the mistakes. It is also important to practice forgiveness, it has some positive impact. At the same time sharing the feelings are also important in this regard. 


**2.	Self-regulation:**

There is perhaps no psychological skill more fundamental than resisting impulse. It is the root of all emotional self-control, since all emotions, by their very nature, lead to one or another impulse to act. The root meaning of the word emotion, remember, is "to move." The capacity to resist that impulse to act, to squelch the incipient movement, most likely translates at the level of brain function into inhibition of limbic signals to the motor cortex, though such an interpretation must remain speculative for now. [5]

It is found that the people who are better at impulse control are socially competent, personally effective, self-assertive, and better able to cope with the frustrations of life. They were less likely to go to pieces, freeze, or regress under stress, or become rattled and disorganized when pressured; they embraced challenges and pursued them instead of giving up even in the face of difficulties; they were self-reliant and confident, trustworthy and dependable; and they took initiative and plunged into projects. And, more than a decade later, they were still able to delay gratification in pursuit of their goals. [6]


**3.	Motivation**

Motivation has been defined as the inner condition of man that swells in vigor to become active. It is also defined as something that encourages a person toward certain goals or that which influences a person’s learning strategies and cognitive process (Ormrod, 1995). [7]
In this day and age, motivation and communication have been found to possess a significant relationship in the majority of establishments. Literature revealed that, though motivation has played an important role in the enhancement of communication effectiveness the relationship between the two constructs were rarely studied. Some of these studies, have concluded those who were inherently motivated had the habit of looking at an organization’s communication environment as being more honest than externally motivated ones (Krivonos ,1975). Thus, motivation, in a later study was recognized as one of the ways to for attain communication effectiveness (Locke, 1976). To reiterate this point, another study concluded that without an adequate measure of motivation, communication probably would not take place effectively (Scott, 2008). [7]

**4.	Empathy**

Empathy is the perceiving the emotions of others. It is important to identify the emotions of others for effective interpersonal communication.  Empathy is the foundation for the ability to understand others, empathetic persons paying more attention to the feelings of others and being more capable of understanding and supporting them in any situation. Generally, studies have shown that emotional intelligence relies more on empathy and positive interaction and less on conflict and antagonism in interpersonal relationships (Brackett, Mayer, Warner, 2004; Lopes, Salovey, Strauss, 2003). [3]
On an average, women outrun men in terms of empathy and emotional expressiveness as results from the conducted analysis. To this effect, we should mention that our society has subtle norms regarding the way emotions are expressed, being considered that expressing fear or sadness belongs particularly to women whereas expressing anger "belongs" to men, norms that tacitly approve a woman crying openly but not a man shedding tears in distress (Hess, Adams & Kleck, 2005). It may be measured by the level of emotional intelligence that a person has in terms of the impact that this exerts upon us and of our impact upon it. From the point of view, a best level may be reached by combining self-control with empathy, respectively the tacit understanding of what somebody else feels and thinks (empathetic precision), skills that emotional intelligence is built upon. Educating these traits becomes available through practice and constitutes new future challenges. [3]

**5. Social Skills**

Social skills are learned behaviors that facilitate interaction with others in the social and work environment in an effective manner. As an example, the social skills of nursing professionals include their ability to communicate effectively and provide high-quality care to the patients. This factor is associated with better physical and emotional health outcomes for patients, such as increased adherence to treatment and improved survival; it is also associated with more social support, improved quality of life and fewer mental health problems in nurses. Therefore, they are essential for the personal and professional development of nurses. In this context, empathy, as part of social skills, is especially important. Consequently, they have a positive attitude towards communication, leading to a higher-quality communication process, which generates more effective support relationships and improved health outcomes.[3]

A study was conducted and sought to answer whether possessing social skills, which stipulated that emotional intelligence and social skills, especially empathy, could predict the attitude towards communication of nurses, and on the other hand, which stated that the absence of social skills would predict the absence of attitude towards communication of nurses. It was revealed that in the case of professional women, only emotional repair predicted attitude towards communication. In student nurses emotional care and repair and empathy, together with low exposure to new situations and low social skills in the academic environment, predicted an attitude towards communication. It is striking that emotional attention is a predictor of emotional skills since generally extreme levels (high or low) of this variable have been associated with the presence of mental health problems.[3]

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, emotional intelligence is not only a "soft skill" but also a foundational competency for effective managerial communication and organizational success in Bangladesh. It is essential to apply and practice the Emotional Intelligence strategies for the betterment of work culture in key industries like the ready-made garments (RMG) sector, IT Sectors, Food & Beverage companies, production sector of Consumable items, Home Appliances manufacturing sectors, Light Engineering farms, Telecommunication sectors and also all the growing start-up companies of the country. By applying the principles of self-awareness, self-regulation, empathy, and social skills, managers can move beyond simply giving directives to building trust, maintaining psychological health, and creating a collaborative work environment in every work place in Bangladesh.
